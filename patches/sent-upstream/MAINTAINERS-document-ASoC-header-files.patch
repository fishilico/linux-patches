Subject: [PATCH] MAINTAINERS: document ASoC header files

include/sound/simple_card_utils.h is handled by ASoC maintainers, as
stated in https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/8/22/307, and
include/sound/simple_card.h seems to be an ASoC file too. In the future
there will be more files named like these ones so introduce a pattern to
match them.
