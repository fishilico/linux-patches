ALWAYS perform these steps before sending a patch
-------------------------------------------------

* Check there is no WIP commit modifying part of it, or the same files
* Check linux-next does not interfere with it
  https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/tree/
* Run check_patch
* Verify typos in the message
* Check my email address

The long checklist is available in linux/Documentation/SubmitChecklist

For wireless patches: https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/developers/documentation/submittingpatches#checking_state_of_patches_from_patchwork
